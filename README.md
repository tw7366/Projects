# Data Analysis Portfolio

##### __Who I am__
  I am a recent graduate of the University of Toronto who have pursued a Bachelor of Science degree. Ever since I took computer science courses in my school, I always had an interest in learning programming. Additionally, earning a double major in mathematics and economics helped me to realize how much I love working with data, which ultimately led me to the field of data analysis. 
  
##### __Why this repository was created__
  Having a solid background of statistics and some experience with python, I was able to grasp the fundamentals of data analysis quickly. With SQL and python, I could flexibly express my ideas and thoughts to process data in an advanced manner. To further my knowledge, I thought it would be great to work on some projects to practice and test my capability. Undoubtedly, it has delivered a significant improvement of my programming and critical thinking skills, thus I am continuing the lessons to polish and learn more complex concepts.
  
##### __What I am learning__
  I started my lessons with Excel to learn the powerful tools like VLOOPUP, pivot table, and conditional formulas, then moved on to SQL. Using MySQL and PostgreSQL, I tracked statistics of a game I played with friends. By creating a database and tables from scratch, I was able to understand the optimal design of tables and eventually got comfortable with RDBMS. Currently, I'm more focused on learning python. Python is definitely an attractive language as it's far more complex and difficult due to its flexiblity. With it, I am able to perform data cleansing, web scraping, data tidying, quantitative & qualitative analysis, and visualization. Now, I am learning more advanced concepts of regression analysis and predictive analytics while polishing acquired skills. 

##### __My thoughts__
  I like the fact that I'm able to write and build something that's more efficient and practical as I put more effort, thus it keeps me motivated. When it comes to learning, I believe one's attitude determine how far one goes. As I desire to continuously mature my knowledge and reach further, I am convinced that I can become a highly productive data analyst one day.
