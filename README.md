# Data Analysis Portfolio

##### __Who I am__
  I am a recent grad of University of Toronto who have pursued a Bachelor of Science degree. I have finished a double major in mathematics and economics, thus I was able to build a solid foundation to perform data analysis. 
##### __Why I am learning Python__
  The problem was that my knowledge of programming languages was really limited to start a career as a data analyst; hence, I couldn't fully express my ideas or thoughts to process data. However, as recent job searching has been challenging due to the pandemic, I thought it was a great idea to use this time to learn some programminig languages that are related to data management.
##### __What I am learning__
I started data analysis with SQL and Excel, which got me quite comfortable with RDBMS. Currently, I'm more focused on learning python, specifically pandas, seaborn and matplotlib libraries to create dataframes and to visualize data. Python is definitely an attractive language. Compared to SQL, it's far more complex and difficult due to its flexiblity. With looping and functions, it's possible to create something that's not much logical in SQL. Of course, it takes lots of practicing, reading, understanding and thinking to fully grasp ideas, but I guess it's an inevitable procedure of learning something new. Thankfully, I do enjoy learning programming languages. I like the fact that I'm able to write or build something that's more efficient and practical as I put more time into it.
##### __Why this repository was created__
This github repository has been created to keep track of my projects. Although not intended, it pushes me to learn more programming to update my files daily, so I'm really glad I've already got a habit of using github.
As I get more comfortable with these programming languages, I hope to analyze more complex datasets that are closely related to my interest.
